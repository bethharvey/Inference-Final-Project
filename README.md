# Inference-Final-Project
 
This is my unguided final project for the Codecademy Data Science Inference Specialty career path.

I used the data available from my Garmin watch to analyze trends in the data from my runs over the past five years. I also used linear regression modelling to predict my average mile pace based on features of the run. The Python libraries I used in this project are Pandas, MatPlotLib, NumPy, and Statsmodels.
